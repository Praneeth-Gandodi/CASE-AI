# CASE - AI Agent

CASE is an AI assistant designed to be your intelligent companion, much like J.A.R.V.I.S. from Iron Man. The idea is to create an AI that can understand what you need, help you get things done, and have natural conversations with you.

Right now, the project is just getting started, so there's a lot more to come!

## What's Working Now

- Works with different AI providers like OpenAI, Groq, Google Gemini, and others
- Has a nice-looking terminal interface where you can chat with the AI
- Remembers conversation history and can summarize chats
- Can switch between different AI models and providers

## How to use

``` bash
# Clone this repo
git clone https://github.com/Praneeth-Gandodi/CASE-AI
cd CASE-AI

# Install the requirements and launch
pip install -r requirements.txt
python -m cli.cli

```

- **Note:** After launching, ensure a provider and model in settings.

## Coming Soon

- **Text-to-Speech**: So the AI can actually talk back to you with a voice
- **Speech-to-Text**: So you can speak to the AI instead of typing
- **Web Interface**: A website where you can use the AI instead of just the terminal
- **Research Tools**: Built-in web search to find information on the internet
- **Task Automation**: Tools to help with everyday tasks
- **Sub-Agents**: Specialized AI helpers for specific jobs
- **Better Memory**: So the AI remembers more about past conversations
- **Voice Control**: Full hands-free interaction

## The Big Picture

The goal is to build an AI that feels like having your own personal J.A.R.V.I.S. - something that understands what you need before you even ask, helps manage your day, finds information for you, and becomes a real digital companion. It's a big dream, but that's where we're heading!

The project is still in its early days, but with time, it should grow into something really useful.
